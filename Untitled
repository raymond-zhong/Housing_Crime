As I promised Victor here is an outline for tomorrow so take a look at your part:

Each member can introduce and pass on the the next member to say that the next feature will be discussed by next member...

1. Introduction team and the need for this app- Speaker: Raymond (Computer: Victor or Soumya)
2. Crimes, Houses and Price Filter- Ryan (Computer: Soumya or Raymond)
3. Search bar, Google Map/pointers Housing Info- Speaker: Victor (Computer: Raymond or Ryan)
4. About team and Other Resources tab (where people are free to explore and learn how nicely integrated our app is)- Speaker: Soumya (Computer: Ryan or Victor)
5. Closing statements: Raymond

It would be nice if the current member can pass the torch by stating what the next topic and who will be getting into it more...
I will try to dress up a bit for the presentation. The guide is just a suggestion and if you feel uncomfortable would like to change your part, we can do so.
